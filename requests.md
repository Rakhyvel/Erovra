- Upgrade function
	- Faster production
	- More health
	- Takes a minute to convert

	- Building list
	- Decomission
- ~~Errormessage doens't fade out properly~~
	- ~~Or topedos~~
- ~~Can't change planes target~~
	- ~~Attackers do change targets, but revert when there are no units around~~
- ~~Bombers can trap user if they were selected as they dropped bombs~~
- ~~Artillery range is in wrong position~~
- ~~Bombs are drawn wrong, probably from resizing~~
- ~~Can still highlight units when dropdown is open~~
	- Would be inconsistent with ships
- ~~AI should focus on making two cities first~~
- ~~Dropboxes should follow units~~
- ~~Decommisioning should lower costs~~
- ~~Airplanes should select themselves only if nothing else is~~
	- Again weirdly inconsistent
- Really gotta try to fix airplane aim
- Can't decommision cities, need to to be able to repair/upgrade
