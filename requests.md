- Upgrade function
	- ~~Faster production~~
	- ~~More health~~
	- ~~Takes a minute to convert~~
	- If not full health, should repair, taking longer the more damaged and higher it is
- Repair function
	- Fully upgraded buildings would obviously only be able to repair
- ~~Bombers should target other buildings, target capital if nothing left, and don't build bombers if theres no buildings except capital~~
- ~~Infantry can target capital from farther away~~
- Pop ups should ask if I really want to cancel or demolish ???
- ~~Cities should only have two drop down spaces~~
- Industry should tell how long things will take ???
- ~~Fix mountains so they don't get white-clipped~~
- ~~Display telling what capital is producing~~
- Planes spaz at -45 degree angle
- ~~Decommisioning an airfield doesn't lower the cost~~
- ~~Tabs didn't align with what was displayed for factory~~
- ~~Factory changes whats being produced based on tabs~~
- ~~Maybe make bombers 30 coins, and attackers 20?~~
- Make a background for time, so it doesn't get washed out ???
- ~~Fix attackers so they target enemy capital~~
- ~~Make upgrade only 20 seconds long~~
- ~~Can still buy things even though we shouldnt be able to, indsitry doesn't take weight into account~~
- ~~Bombers just sorta disappear when no more targets, should bomb capital and return~~
- ~~Bombers increase cost for enemy team, shouldn't~~
- ~~Dropdown stays visible even if you change maps~~
- ~~Ships probably don't escort right~~
- Fighter planes can take damage from infantry bullets
- Weird bug that makes it so you have to press multiple times to upgrade a brand new factory
	- Also happens when you have a city upgrading and its drop down open, won't let you upgrade after its finished upgrading. Need to close out of 	drop down
- Fighters cost 5 coins, but canceling the order gives back 10 coins
- Drop down still doesn't open on the right tab for factories
- Map out costs of things, make sure everything makes sense especially with time taken to build things
	- Upgrading should give diminishing returns
	- As of rn, upgrading fully and buying a unit there is faster than buying a unit on light upgrade. Shouldn't be the case
- Plane shadows go crazy on edges
- Planes shadows should be on the ground, their sprite should be elevated
- Landing craft need dropdown

- Squad functions
	- Patrol
	- Task forces
	- Offensive mode??
	- Box select
	- Paths
	- Pressing a key shows all units arrows
