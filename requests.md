- Upgrade function
	- ~~Faster production~~
	- ~~More health~~
	- ~~Takes a minute to convert~~
	- If not full health, should repair, taking longer the more damaged and higher it is
- Repair function

- ~~Make upgrade only 20 seconds long~~
- ~~Can still buy things even though we shouldnt be able to, indsitry doesn't take weight into account~~

	- Also happens when you have a city upgrading and its drop down open, won't let you upgrade after its finished upgrading. Need to close out of 	drop down
	- Could not reproduce?
- ~~Fighters cost 5 coins, but canceling the order gives back 10 coins~~
- ~~Drop down still doesn't open on the right tab for factories~~
- ~~Map out costs of things, make sure everything makes sense especially with time taken to build things~~
	- ~~Upgrading should give diminishing returns~~
	- ~~As of rn, upgrading fully and buying a unit there is faster than buying a unit on light upgrade. Shouldn't be the case~~
- Plane shadows go crazy on edges ??
	- Never reproduced
